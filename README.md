POLIGLOTA

Initially created to learn French vocabulary, I decided to add English and Spanish, as I also want to improve my vocabulary in these languages. Then I decided to add Italian, German, Chinese and Russian, as they are languages that I am interested to learn in the future.

I practiced a lot of CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Database and AJAX, besides learning a little more French, which was the only language that I checked the translation of most of the content, the others I just translated using the Reverso dictionary.

I want to make some improvements like: adding images, a button to go back to the previous word, improving the layout, checking translations and putting some command that allows to start a category in a specific point, to make possible to stop and continue in another moment.
